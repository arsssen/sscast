SSCast
======
Chrome plugin that allows casting of videos from some websites directrly 
to Chromecast and control playback, volume, play/pause etc.

Required
======
Chromecast and Chrome browser.

Supported websites.
======
Note that support is limited to what Chromecast can play. Chromecast cannot play
FLVs which is very popular (although declining finally) so some videos on
stepashka cannot be played.

* stepashka.com
* any website with mp4/webm/mkv link on it. Yup your favorite hard drive
mounted to directory visible by with Option +Indexes. Don't forget access
control!

TODO
======
Add support for more websites.

Known issues
======
Those may be fixed in future. Although mobile Chrome is probably going to make
this obsolete eventually.
* Storage is implemented incorrectly :( So list of playable files will disapper,
refresh page if it happens.
* Extension monitors only active tab, so please wait until loading completes.
* Player controls are funky sometimes.
